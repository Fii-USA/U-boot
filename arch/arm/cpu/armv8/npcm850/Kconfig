	  Set this number to the maximum number of possible CPUs in the SoC.
	  SoCs may have multiple clusters with each cluster may have multiple
	  ports. If some ports are reserved but higher ports are used for
	  cores, count the reserved ports. This will allocate enough memory
	  in spin table to properly handle all cores.
